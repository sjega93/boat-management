This project is a web-based boat management application. The frontend is built using Vue.js and is deployed on AWS Amplify, while the backend is built with ExpressJS and deployed as AWS Lambda functions. The application leverages AWS Cognito for authentication, which was seamlessly integrated using AWS Amplify. The database is hosted on MongoDB Cloud.
